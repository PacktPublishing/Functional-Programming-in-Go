## About the Video Course
Functional Programming in Go aims to demonstrate existing Go developers how to write more reliable code based on the principles of Functional Programming. We will start with a quick refresher in Go, continuing in showing the ins and outs of functions, higher order functions as well explaining the benefits of immutability, currying and design patterns with real world examples. In the end we will have a look at unit testing using error and assertion based approaches.

We will explain abstract mathematical terms like Monoids, Monads and Functors in a simple and practical way used in Programming. Besides that we will have a look at the advantages and disadvantages at all principles backed by arguments and examples.This course is ideal for anybody already familiar with Go and has used Go mostly with Object Oriented Principles in mind and would like to start building reliable, concurrent apps in Go using Functional Programming.
